## Objective

Given a any number **n**
Write a program that prints the integers from   **1**   to   **n**   (inclusive).

But:

    * for multiples of three,   print   **Fizz**    (instead of the number)
    * for multiples of five,   print   **Buzz**     (instead of the number)
    * for multiples of both three and five,   print   **FizzBuzz**     (instead of the number)
